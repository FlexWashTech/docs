# Change Existing Member's Status

### Scenario

What to do if a customer that is already enrolled in a membership package wants to change to a different one?

### Steps

1. After finding the customer’s profile in the **“Customer”** section of admin, scroll down to the bottom to see the list of vehicles associated with this customer.

2. You will be able to see if the vehicles are listed in any particular membership package.

3. For this example, the first car on this customer’s list required a change of membership. It is already enrolled in a membership called **“Total Shine Unlimited”**, but now the customer wants to be on the **VIP package**.

4. Click on the **“Membership package”** section to see a drop-down with all the available membership packages. Select the new one that the customer is requesting.

5. Finally, don’t forget to hit the **save** button at the very bottom of the page for any changes to take effect!
